Writing your own introduction is hard. I have a <a href="http://blog.mattgauger.com">blog</a>. I share links and highlights at [annotate.mattgauger.com](http://annotate.mattgauger.com).

I like to build things with hardware and software.

You can find me on freenode IRC as `mathiasx` (in `#symbolics` and `#intaug`). I am [mathias](https://github.com/mathias) on GitHub. I don't use other social media.

I started [intaug.org](https://intaug.org) to build a community around developing intelligence augmentation software.

Please do [email me](mailto:contact@mattgauger.com).
