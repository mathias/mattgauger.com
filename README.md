My personal site.

## How?

I used my own development version of [ecstatic](https://github.com/mathias/ecstatic/tree/beta) which works well enough for my uses. [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/) was used for the force-directed graph.

I deployed it to my personal server because it was already set up. Rather than write a deploy script, I just copied the files into place with SFTP.
